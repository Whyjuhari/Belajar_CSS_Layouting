        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi all, my name is Juhari. I'm from sambali-wali, to be precise, it
          could be in the mountains. I am currently a student at the University
          of West Sulawesi. and majored in informatics. It's the department that
          makes people dizzy. But thank God I'm also quite dizzy wkwkwkwk. But
          I'm sure, once you're used to it, you'll understand.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, about myself, I want to tell you a little bit. What if I were the
          person, Grandpa, how come, it's hard to explain. But, I'm the most
          difficult to talk. it's just like small talk, blah blah blah, it's not
          clear. So I prefer to talk about the basics, actually. So for example,
          if you say wow, this is an arrogant person. Oh, it's not arrogant,
          it's just that.
